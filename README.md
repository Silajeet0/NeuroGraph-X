# NeuroGraph-X

**NeuroGraph-X** is a machine learning research project exploring neural architectures on graph-structured data.  
The goal of this repository is to build, experiment with, and evaluate models that combine deep learning with graph representations for advanced pattern discovery and inference.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Graph-based learning is central to many modern AI applications — social networks, molecular modeling, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.

NeuroGraph-X aims to:

- Develop neural models operating on graph structures  
- Experiment with representation learning techniques  
- Analyze performance on structured datasets  
- Provide modular experimentation infrastructure  

This repository serves as a research sandbox and development base for future extensions.
